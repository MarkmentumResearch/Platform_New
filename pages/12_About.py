Markets + Momentum = Markmentum Research.  A structured framework for disciplined trading, investing, and portfolio management.
</p>

<p style="font-weight:600; margin:12px 0 18px;">
We deliver volatility-adjusted probable ranges, proprietary scoring, and AI-generated market reads that frame growth and inflation expectations — plus probability-driven signals across major market tickers and indices—through a sleek, modern portal. Actionable data. Focused insights. Zero noise.
</p>

<p style="font-weight:600; margin:12px 0 18px;">You're the captain. We provide the coordinates. Let us help you navigate markets with clarity and confidence.</p>

<h3>Why Markmentum Research</h3>
<p>
  Traditional buy-and-hold investing has long been taught as the optimal strategy for long-term wealth creation. While it can still play a role, today’s markets are more volatile, more cyclical, and more sensitive to macro forces than in the past. 
  As a result, investors increasingly need tools that help manage risk dynamically while seeking consistent compounding over multiple time horizons.
</p>
<p>
  Markmentum Research provides a volatility-adjusted, probability-driven market framework designed to help investors better understand risk and reward across daily, weekly, and longer-term timeframes. 
  By combining price behavior, trend structure, and quantitative signals, our approach helps users tilt exposure toward asymmetric opportunities where upside potential outweighs downside risk—while avoiding crowded, stretched setups.
</p>
<p>
  Rather than relying on narratives or predictions, Markmentum emphasizes disciplined, data-driven decision-making to support capital preservation and repeatable outcomes across changing market regimes.
</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Morning Compass</b> – Your orientation dashboard across major indices, sectors, and macro levers — with a one-click Daily / Weekly / Monthly selector. 
  Displays probable ranges, risk/reward bias, and Markmentum Scores for key macro exposures (Indices, S&P 500 sectors, Gold, USD, TLT, BTC Futures), plus top 5 gainers and laggards by % change and by Markmentum Score, 
  along with an optional category snapshot for deeper drill-downs. On the Daily view, Morning Compass also includes USD and Rates Correlation snapshots, showing how equities, sectors, commodities, and other assets have recently moved 
  relative to the U.S. Dollar (via DXY) and 10-Year Treasury yields — helping frame near-term sensitivity and cross-asset influences. Auto-refreshed for a concise, data-first read on market direction, sector and individual name leadership, and risk/reward positioning.</li>
  <li><b>Market Overview</b> – A single, unified page with a timeframe selector (Daily / Weekly / Monthly / Quarterly). Each view displays the top percentage gainers and decliners, Most Active (Shares), and Markmentum Score change distribution.
    The Daily view additionally includes the Top-10 Highest and Lowest Markmentum Scores, a Markmentum Score histogram, and the Opportunity Density report, which summarizes the distribution of Buy, Neutral, and Sell setups across categories based on Risk/Reward and Markmentum Score thresholds.
      At the bottom of the page, each timeframe features an AI-generated Market Read summarizing key market dynamics and macro context.</li>
  <li><b>Performance Heatmap</b> – Multi-layered view of realized market performance across categories and tickers. Begins with key macro tickers and category-level averages, then allows a drill-down by category to explore per-ticker percentage changes. 
  Displays Daily, WTD, MTD, and QTD returns, with each timeframe independently scaled for clarity. The layout combines table and heatmap views to show where performance strength or weakness has already occurred, complementing the forward-looking insights from the Markmentum Heatmap. 
  Includes a sortable, searchable, and downloadable table at the bottom.</li>
  <li><b>Sharpe Rank Heatmap</b> – Multi-layered view of risk-adjusted performance across categories and tickers. Begins with key macro tickers and category-level averages, then allows a drill-down by category to explore per-ticker Sharpe Percentile Ranks. 
  Displays current rank alongside Daily, WTD, MTD, and QTD changes, with each timeframe independently scaled for clarity. The layout combines table and heatmap views to highlight where relative performance strength or weakness is emerging across the market. 
  Includes a sortable, searchable, and downloadable table at the bottom.</li>
  <li><b>Markmentum Heatmap</b> – Multi-layered view of opportunity and risk across the entire instrument universe. Begins with key macro tickers and category-level averages, then allows a drill-down by category to see detailed per-ticker positioning.

  <li><b>Vantage Point</b> – Unified snapshot of Sharpe Rank, Markmentum Score, and Tape Bias by timeframe. Starts with macro orientation, then averages by category, and finally drills down to per-ticker detail. 
  Highlights where performance, risk, and sentiment are aligning or diverging across the market.</li>
  <li><b>Deep Dive Dashboard</b> – Full per instrument view: probable ranges, probable anchors, trend lines, gap-to-anchor, volatility stats, Sharpe percentile ranks, Markmentum Score, and more.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Methodology</h3>
<ul>
  <li><b>Probable Ranges</b> – Calculated independently for highs and lows using: (1) the high or low price series, (2) realized volatility on that series, (3) volatility-of-volatility on that series, and (4) volume volatility. 
  These inputs generate the probable high and low across daily, weekly, and monthly horizons. By building the model on highs and lows—rather than just closes—the ranges capture more information about market behavior. </li>
  <li><b>Directional Trends</b> – Short-, mid-, and long-term composites derived by netting the volatility-adjusted factors behind probable highs and lows, providing a directional trend signal.</li>
  <li><b>Probable Anchors</b> – Anchor levels are extrapolated by aligning short-term trend structure with long-term trend structure, creating a probabilistic reference to gauge extension and mean-reversion risk.</li>
  <li><b>Volatility Stats</b> – 30-day Z-scores, Percentile Ranks, Ivol/Rvol Spreads, and Regime Flags.</li>
  <li><b>Markmentum Score</b> – A proprietary, rules-based, volatility-adjusted risk/reward framework that blends multiple market signals into a single intuitive scale. A high positive score favors the long side; a negative score favors the short side.</li>
</ul>
